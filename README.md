# Bachelors_thesis
This repository serves as the culmination of my Bachelor's thesis, where I focused on advancing the Pix2Code framework through the implementation and optimization of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks.  Pix2Code is a pioneering technology that converts graphical user interface (GUI) designs into executable code, streamlining the software development process.

This repository showcases my efforts to enhance the Pix2Code model by incorporating bidirectional LSTM architecture, a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) known for capturing contextual dependencies in both forward and backward directions. Through meticulous experimentation and fine-tuning, I have tailored the bidirectional LSTM to better understand and interpret the intricacies of graphical representations, ultimately improving the accuracy and efficiency of code generation.

Key Features:

Bidirectional LSTM Implementation: A comprehensive implementation of bidirectional LSTM within the Pix2Code framework, allowing the model to leverage contextual information from both past and future tokens during the code generation process.

Training Data Augmentation: Techniques for augmenting training data to expose the model to diverse input scenarios, ensuring robust performance across various GUI designs and layouts.

Optimized Hyperparameters: Fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve an optimal balance between model complexity and training efficiency, maximizing the overall performance of EnhancedPix2Code.

Evaluation Metrics: In-depth analysis of the model's performance using established evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, providing a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.

By sharing this repository, I aim to contribute to the ongoing research in code generation from graphical interfaces and provide a valuable resource for developers and researchers interested in advancing Pix2Code and bidirectional LSTM-based approaches. The EnhancedPix2Code repository represents a step forward in the quest for more accurate and context-aware code generation from visual elements.
